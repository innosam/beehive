BEEHIVE: A Map Reduce framework 
A mini project to facilitate learning in 
: Networking Programming
: Linux System Calls
: Raw Data manipulation Algorithms(Map Reduce)
: C++


>To test your Map Reduce Algorithms on C++
>Learn more about Ashyncronous Network Programming
>Get Familiar with LINUX system calls



To Start Using MapReduce Algorithm with Multiple Clients

i
1> MapReduce.cpp
Modify #PATH: Temporary and Output Files are Stored Here

2> Code the Input File and Task 

Compile:
A simple make


To Run:

./server <port Number>
./tcli <server address> <server port> 
  CMD: start wordcount
  It does wordcount for the linux dictionary file
  (The input file is configurable)

./client <server address> <server port> <groupId>
You can run multiple clients
To start multiple client, i use library called paramiko, which can login to differnt manchines and start of clients.
Just google parmiko


To add Custom Task:
>Look for sample task(wordcount) in MapReduce.cpp
>Both MAP and REDUCE Functions for a particular task has to be coded.
>Specify the input file, and task name:
  Let the framework do its work


To DO:
1> Make Interface of CLI more user friendly

2> Add more sample task, that can be performed and scaled with this framework

3> Consider the possibility fo Implementing Table Join with the current framework


BEEHIVE v2
>Improve on the current Implementation to support Hadoop like framework in C++
